				</header>
				<p>When people hear "gravity" or "theories of gravity", it's often attributed to Sir Isaac Newton, or Johannes Kepler. </p>
				<p>But many of these theories might not have been possible, without Tycho Brahe's theory on Gravity.
                    Tycho Brahe's theories of gravity aren't much known, neither do we have much clarity about it, but </p>
				<p>there was one assumption which Tycho himself carried throughout his life, the assumption that Earth was the center of the universe, and refused to believe anything but Earth being the center.
                    His theory of gravity shows how important it is for an astronomer to set aside beliefs and superstitions, in order to observe real and proven data.
                </p>
                <p>His experimentation was to create more of a geocentric model of our universe, because after all that's what he set to prove, that the Earth is at the center of the universe. 
                    But it's evident, that without Brahe's calculations on his theory of gravity, more accurate theories based on it would've been less accurate without his theory.
                    
                    </p>

				<h2>Kepler's Law</h2>
				<p>He found out lanets went in elipthical paths rather than circular</p>
				<p>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span class=" text-muted"> ▶ Law 1 - Law of orbits <br></span></li>
                            
                            <li><span class=" text-muted"> ▶ Law 2 - Law of equal areas <br></span></li>
                            <li><span class=" text-muted"> ▶ Law 3 - Law of periods<br></span></li>
                        </ul>
                        Kepler's laws of planetary motion are three scientific laws which explain the motion of planets around sun.
                    </p>
                </p>

				<blockquote>“If today I can see any further that is because I am standing on shoulders of <i>Giants</i> ~ Sir Issac Newton”</blockquote>
				

				
				<p>Kepler's <b>first law</b> stated that ” All the planets revolve around the sun in elliptical orbits having the sun at one of the foci”.</p>
				<p> The point at which a planet is close to the sun is called perihelion and the point at which the planet is farther from sun is called aphelion.</p>
                <p> Kepler's <b>second law</b> stated that ” The radius vector drawn from the sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time”.</p>
                <p>
                    Since the orbit isn't circular, the planet's kinetic energy isn't constant in its path. It possesses more kinetic energy
                    near perihelion and less kinetic energy near aphelion implies more pace at perihelion and less pace at aphelion.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Kepler's <b>third law</b> stated that ” The square of the time period of revolution of a planet around the sun in an elliptical orbit is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis”.
                </p>

                <h2>Galileo's observations</h2>
                <div class="">
                     <p>
                        According to legend, Galileo was pretty practical in his experimentation, so practical that he dropped weights off the Leaning Tower of Pisa, with which he wanted to show that gravity causes objects of different mass to fall with the same acceleration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Though scientists and thinkers like Aristotle had created theories which were later worked on, Galileo was the first one to get it right.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He realised that a falling body had to pick up speed at a constant rate, which meant constant acceleration, He also made an important observation that, if air resistance and buoyancy can be neglected, every body fall with same acceleration, regardless of their weight. 

                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Galileo also noted that, say a ball rolls without interference on a smooth horizontal surface, and friction and air resistance can be nullified, it will move with constant speed in a fixed direction, which means that it's velocity remains constant.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Galileo Galilei was indeed a pivotal figure in the development of modern astronomy, both because of his contributions directly to astronomy, and because of his work in physics and its relation to astronomy. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h2>Newton with the force</h2>
                <p>
                    Newton was one of the most important people in developing an accurate theory for gravity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His <b>law of universal gravitation</b> states that "Every particle attracts every other particle in the universe with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers."
                </p>
                <p>
                   <h2> F = GMm/r²</h2>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The publication of this theory is now known as the "first great unification", as it is evidently the unification of the previously descibed phenomena of gravity on Earth with known astronomical behaviour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reason which lead him to discovering gravity, as we all know, was an apple falling on his head one summer afternoon, which made him think about the gravitational force it initialized.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Newton questioned why an object would fall without any tangible force acting upon it. 
                    He also noticed that there were forces that attracted objects towards each other, rather ubiquitously.
                    However, he also noticed that the force of attraction varied from the size of the object.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Larger masses attract smaller masses, and it also depends on the distance between the objects. It would weaken if the objects were further apart, and strengthen if it was nearer.
                    He refered to this as the "Force of Gravity" as we know today
